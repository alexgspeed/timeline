            <p>Week 1 I began working through the Foundations section of The Odin Project. The lessons first went through an overview of the command line, moving into the basics of HTML and CSS. It also touched briefly on things like inspecting/debugging and how to properly request help for coding.</p>
            <p>HTML and CSS information focused on basic elements, that standard box layout structure, and then dove into Flexbox.</p>
